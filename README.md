# workflow

Open the .sln file in the Workflow folder to open the project in Visual Studio
In Visual Studio, on the right side of the screen is the Solution Explorer, which shows all of the files related to the current solution
The main files for our project are .aspx, .aspx.cs, and .cs files
        .aspx files are the HTML files, accepting any HTML code, as well as special <ASP:*** runat="server"/> tags 
        .aspx.cs files are the code-behind for the related .aspx files (press the little arrow on the .aspx files to see these)
              These are regular C# class files, with special events tied to the <ASP:***> tags on the .aspx pages
        .cs files are just regular C# classes, for Models, database connections, helper classes, etc etc
